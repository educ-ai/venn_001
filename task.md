# Take Home Task - Front End (React Native)

## Onboarding Form
### Prerequisites:
- Code should be in repository on any of the available git services (Github,
Bitbucket, Gitlab, etc.)
- Writing code according to standard architectural and design patterns in React
Native is required
- Essential parts should be covered with automated integration tests (React
Native Testing Library preferred)
- Should be written ideally in Typescript (Javascript allowed as well) using React
Native
- - Using React hooks (including custom hooks)
- External libraries (design systems, styles, form validations, validation schema
(yup, zod), UI components) are allowed and encouraged
- ESLint configuration is optional, but nice to have
- Expo or React Native CLI can be used (optionally)

Disclaimer: Please read and follow all instructions. *Treat the submissions as
though it is production ready code* - where code is properly in abstracted files,
DRY and ready to be PR reviewed.

*Challenge*: Build a simple onboarding form where user can type their personal
and business details.
User should be able to:
- Type a first name (size limit 50 chars)
- Type a last name (size limit 50 chars)
- Type a phone number (validate if phone number is correct, only Canadian
numbers are allowed). Phone number shouldn’t contain any special
characters except + at the beginning. Should start with country code +1 .
- Type a corporation number. Length should be 9 chars, should be validated

asynchronously by making GET request to a given endpoint. URL: https://fe-
hometask-api.qa.vault.tryvault.com/corporation-number/:number . For correct corporation

number response will be for example:
```
{
"corporationNumber": "123456789",
"valid": true
}
```

for bad corporation number there will be:
```
{
"valid": false,
"message": "Invalid corporation number"
}
```

List of valid corporation numbers (do not hardcode it, only for testing
purpose):
```
[
"826417395",
"158739264",
"123456789",
"591863427",
"312574689",
"287965143",
"265398741",
"762354918",
"468721395",
"624719583",
]
```
- All of the above form fields are required and appropriate validation should
occur onBlur (including validation of corporation number via API)
- Submit a form if all of the fields were filled by clicking “Submit” button.
Submission should validate fields and if any of values are missing,
appropriate validation message should appear under respective field. After
validation is made form values should be sent to an API using POST
method. URL: https://fe-hometask-api.qa.vault.tryvault.com/profile-details . Example of
request:
```
{
"firstName": "Hello",
"lastName": "World",
"corporationNumber": "826417395",
"phone": "+13062776103"
}
```

For successful form submission there will be just 200 status in response. For
failed submission there will be a 400 status code and a message if any field is
missing or if any field didn’t pass a validation on back-end. For example:
```
{
"message": "Invalid phone number"
}
```
